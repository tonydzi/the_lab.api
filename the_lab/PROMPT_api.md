## How Experiments Work

You have access to a local experiment management API. Use it to structure your work.

### Important habits

- **Before concluding an idea, check whether your metric actually improved.** Use `leaderboard_search(metric="...", sort="desc")` or `GET /leaderboard/search?metric=...&sort=desc`. If your idea isn't at the top, say so in the conclusion.
- **Do not delegate API work to sub-agents.** Call the MCP tools or curl yourself. Sub-agents don't receive these instructions.

### Core concepts

- **Idea** — a research direction with its own **git branch** (`idea/<id>`). Ideas form a DAG: branch from parents, or merge multiple. Status: `active` → `concluded`/`abandoned`. Concluded ideas can be reopened.
- **Suggested idea** — human-submitted (`status: "suggested"`). Adopt or abandon with a note.
- **Experiment** — a bash script run under an idea, identified by a label like `exp/1.2` (idea 1, experiment 2). Carries `meta` (hyperparams, data), `tags`, and produces `metrics`. Scripts without JSON output succeed as setup tasks.
- **Notes** — journal on an idea. Levels: `insight` (key findings), `milestone` (progress), `observation` (what happened), `debug` (troubleshooting).

### Research workflow

**Start every session by orienting** — `GET /orient` returns active ideas, running experiments, best score, and recommended next steps. Use `?tags=...` to filter by experiment tags.

Then check for human suggestions — `GET /ideas?status=suggested`. Adopt feasible ones, abandon infeasible ones with a note.

The core loop (aim for 5-7 API calls per iteration):

1. **Orient** → `GET /orient` — current state + recommended next action. Follow `next_step`.
2. **Leaderboard + Search** → `GET /leaderboard/search?metric=score&q=keyword` — rankings AND search in one call. Includes the best idea's details — no need to GET individual ideas separately.
3. **Create idea** → `POST /ideas/new {parent_ids, description}` — creates git branch and **auto-checkouts** (no separate checkout call needed).
4. **Create + start experiment** → `POST /ideas/<id>/experiments {description, script_content, meta, tags}` — when `script_content` is provided, the experiment **auto-starts** (no separate start call needed).
5. **Wait** → run `the-lab wait <label> --port <port>` as a **background shell command** (preferred — lets you keep working while waiting). Prints compact JSON including `"done": true|false`. Or call `GET /wait?experiment_id=<id>` directly for simple sequential flows.

   **Branch on the exit code, never on the output text** — `0` = completed, `1` = failed or cancelled (terminal: stop), `2` = not finished yet (timeout, or messages arrived: wait again). Matching words like `error` or `timeout` in the JSON is how retry loops get stuck forever, because keys such as `error` may appear in a perfectly successful result:

   ```bash
   while true; do
     out=$(the-lab wait 3.15 --port 8000); rc=$?
     [ $rc -eq 2 ] || break      # 0/1 are terminal — stop waiting
     sleep 30
   done
   echo "$out"
   ```
5b. **Wait for messages** → run `the-lab messages --port <port>` as a **background shell command** to block until a message arrives in your inbox. Prints a JSON array of unread messages on exit.
6. **Note findings** → `POST /ideas/<id>/note {text, level}`
7. **Conclude** → `POST /ideas/<id>/conclude {conclusion}` — then branch into next idea

If experiments have failed, `GET /experiments/log` returns all failed experiment logs in one call.

### Avoid unnecessary calls

- **Don't GET individual ideas** — `/leaderboard/search` already includes the best idea's details and search results. Reading ideas one-by-one wastes your budget.
- **Don't GET individual experiments** — `/wait` returns the full result. `/experiments/log` returns all failed logs at once.
- Use `/orient` → `/leaderboard/search` → act. Two calls give you everything you need to decide.

### Tag & metric management

Tags categorize experiments by approach. Messy or duplicate tags hurt analysis — normalize them early.

- **List all tags** → `GET /experiments/tags` — returns every tag with its usage count. Start here to see what exists.
- **Rename / normalize tags** → `POST /experiments/tags/rename {"old": "basline", "new": "baseline"}` — fixes typos and consolidates variants across all experiments in one call.
- **Filter by tag** → pass `tags=...` to `/orient` or `/leaderboard/search` to scope results to a specific approach.

Metrics have direction — know which way is better:
- `score` → **higher is better** (default sort is descending, so `/leaderboard/search?metric=score` already does the right thing)
- `convergence_gap` → **lower is better** — use `sort=asc`: `/leaderboard/search?metric=convergence_gap&sort=asc`

When documenting findings, always note what each tag represents (e.g., "table-heavy = lookup-table approach") and which direction each metric optimizes.

### Script contract

Scripts must print `{"metrics": {...}}` as their **last stdout line** (or omit for setup tasks). Optional extras:
- `$THE_LAB_PROGRESS` — write progress JSON for live monitoring
- `$THE_LAB_METRICS` — append JSONL for per-step training curves
- `.the_lab/preamble.sh` — auto-sourced before every script via `source .the_lab/preamble.sh 2>/dev/null || true`; use it for shared helpers

Recommended experiment script pattern:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# your experiment command here
```

**⚠️ Do NOT add `source .the_lab/preamble.sh` to your script.** The harness already injects it automatically with `2>/dev/null || true` so it degrades safely in isolated worktrees. A second bare `source .the_lab/preamble.sh` (without `|| true`) under `set -euo pipefail` will cause the experiment to silently exit before your command ever runs — because `preamble.sh` is gitignored and not present in per-experiment worktrees.

### Git integration

Each idea is a git branch. The server manages branching automatically:
- `POST /ideas/new` creates a branch from the parent idea(s) and auto-checkouts
- Experiments run in isolated git worktrees (concurrent experiments don't interfere)

### File layout

```
.the_lab/
  preamble.sh              # gitignored — harness injects it safely; do not re-source in scripts
  artifacts/               # shared datasets, checkpoints (not branch-specific)
  experiments/
    {idea_id}/
      idea.json            # idea metadata
      notes.json           # append-only journal
      {seq}.json           # experiment metadata + results
      {seq}.sh             # experiment script
      {seq}.log            # stdout+stderr
      {seq}.progress       # optional progress JSON
      {seq}.metrics.jsonl  # optional per-step time-series
```

### API reference

All endpoints are documented with descriptions, parameters, and examples in the OpenAPI spec. Access it via:
- **Dashboard** → API tab (interactive explorer with Send button)
- **Spec** → `GET /openapi.json`
- **Docs** → `GET /docs` (Swagger UI)

### Inter-agent messaging

Agents can send messages to each other via the messages API. Unread messages addressed to you appear in `_notifications` on every API response as a brief preview — call `list_messages` to read the full text, then mark them read.

- **Send** → `POST /api/v1/messages {to, text}` — `to` is `"all"`, `"role:<name>"`, or `"agent:<id>"`
- **Read** → `GET /api/v1/messages?for_me=1` — returns messages addressed to your agent ID, role, or `"all"`
- **Mark read** → `POST /api/v1/messages/{id}/read` — returns `{"status":"ok","id":N}`
- **Mark all read** → `POST /api/v1/messages/read_all` — returns `{"marked_read":N}`

To **wait for incoming messages** in the background:

```bash
the-lab messages --port <port>   # blocks until ≥1 unread message arrives, then prints JSON array
```

Uses `THE_LAB_AGENT_ID` automatically — only returns messages addressed to you (or `"all"`). Exits with `[]` on timeout (default 300s).

### Role-based prompts

Projects can define multiple agent prompts for different roles (e.g. an "instructor" that plans and a "worker" that executes). Prompt files live in `.the_lab/`:

- `.the_lab/PROMPT.md` — the default role (used when no role is specified)
- `.the_lab/PROMPT.<role>.md` — a named role (`[a-z0-9_-]{1,32}`)

Relevant tools:
- `get_instructions(role="<name>")` — load the role-specific prompt. Without a `role`, returns the default. If the requested role doesn't exist, returns the default plus an `available_roles` list so you can retry.
- `list_prompts()` — see which roles are configured.
- The dashboard's **Prompts** tab adds/edits/removes roles.
- Launching: `the-lab-agent --role instructor loop -d 30m` (or `--list-roles` to see what exists).

### MCP tools (when available)

If MCP tools are available (tool names like `orient`, `create_idea`, `wait_for_experiment`),
use them directly instead of curl. The tools map 1:1 to API endpoints.

**Recommended MCP workflow** (aim for 5-7 tool calls per iteration):

1. **orient** → current state + recommended next action
2. **leaderboard_search** → rankings + related ideas in one call
3. **create_idea** → creates branch + auto-checkout
4. **create_experiment** → provide `script_content` to auto-start
5. **wait_for_experiment** → blocks until done, returns full result
6. **add_note** → record findings
7. **conclude_idea** → then branch into next idea

### Notifications

Every API response includes a `_notifications` key when there are actionable items:
- **Suggestions**: human-submitted ideas awaiting adopt/abandon
- **Failures**: experiments that failed (with link to aggregate logs)

Always check `_notifications` in responses — it surfaces urgent items you should not miss.
