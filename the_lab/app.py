# failures that can't be cleared. We now deliver each distinct event to a given
# agent exactly ONCE by tracking the stable notification keys an agent has
# already seen. Stored as .the_lab/agents/notif_seen.json:
#     {"<agent_id>": ["failure:13.4", "suggestion:42", ...], ...}
#
# A freshly-registered agent (no entry yet) is BASELINED: all currently-existing
# keys are marked seen up-front so it isn't spammed with the pre-existing
# backlog — it only receives notifications for events that happen AFTER it
# registered (feedback: NEW-ONLY-ON-REGISTER). Message previews are handled
# separately (messages have their own read tracking) and are NOT routed here.
#
# File IO is fail-soft (a corrupt/missing store never breaks a response) and
# guarded by a module-level lock, mirroring agents.py note_message_poll().
# Store logic lives here because the feedback restricts edits to app.py.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# inject_notifications) — parse/re-dump cost on the loop outweighs the value.
